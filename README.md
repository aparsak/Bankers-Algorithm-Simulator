# üñ•Ô∏è Banker's Algorithm Simulator

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems for resource allocation. The simulator includes two parts: one for static resource allocation and another for dynamic resource allocation scenarios.

## Overview

The Banker's Algorithm ensures that processes request resources in a way that avoids deadlock by dynamically checking if the system's state is safe before granting requests. This repository demonstrates the algorithm's application in both static and dynamic resource allocation environments.

## Static Resource Allocation

Simulates a scenario where processes request and release resources, with safety checks using the Banker's Algorithm.

### Features

- **Safe State Checking:** Evaluates if a resource request can be granted without entering an unsafe state.
- **Resource Request Handling:** Processes request resources; the system decides whether to grant or deny based on the current state.
- **System State Display:** Shows current allocation, maximum resources per process, and resource needs.

### üìÑ Example Output with Static Resource Allocation

Displays the initial system state and processes for resource allocation:

| Process | Max Resources | Allocated Resources | Needed Resources |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
|   P0    |    [7, 5, 3]  |       [0, 1, 0]     |     [7, 4, 3]    |
|   P1    |    [3, 2, 2]  |       [2, 0, 0]     |     [1, 2, 2]    |
|   P2    |    [9, 0, 2]  |       [3, 0, 2]     |     [6, 0, 0]    |
|   P3    |    [2, 2, 2]  |       [2, 1, 1]     |     [0, 1, 1]    |
|   P4    |    [4, 3, 3]  |       [0, 0, 2]     |     [4, 3, 1]    |

Available Resources: [3, 3, 5]

### üì• Input

To interact with the simulation, input the following:

- **Process ID:** The ID of the process requesting resources.
- **Resource Request:** Specify resources requested by the process as a list of integers.

### üì§ Output

The system outputs whether the request is granted or denied based on the Banker's Algorithm evaluation, along with the updated system state.

## Dynamic Resource Allocation

Extends the simulation by allowing resources to be dynamically added to the system over time.

### Features

- **Dynamic Resource Addition:** Simulates the addition of resources at random intervals.
- **Real-time Safe State Evaluation:** Continuously checks the system's safety state as resources are added and processes request more resources.
- **Threaded Execution:** Uses separate threads to handle resource requests and dynamic changes concurrently.

### üìÑ Example Output with Dynamic Resources

Displays the initial system state with dynamic resources added:

| Process | Max Resources | Allocated Resources | Needed Resources |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
|   P0    |    [7, 5, 3]  |       [0, 1, 0]     |     [7, 4, 3]    |
|   P1    |    [3, 2, 2]  |       [2, 0, 0]     |     [1, 2, 2]    |
|   P2    |    [9, 0, 2]  |       [3, 0, 2]     |     [6, 0, 0]    |
|   P3    |    [2, 2, 2]  |       [2, 1, 1]     |     [0, 1, 1]    |
|   P4    |    [4, 3, 3]  |       [0, 0, 2]     |     [4, 3, 1]    |

Available Resources: [3, 3, 5]

#### Dynamic Resource Addition

- **Resources added:** [2, 1, 3]
- **New total resources:** [5, 4, 8]
- **New available resources:** [1, 2, 5]

This section demonstrates how the simulator handles changes in resource availability and continues to manage process requests using the Banker's Algorithm.
